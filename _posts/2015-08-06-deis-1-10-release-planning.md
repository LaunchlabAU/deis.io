The Deis [open roadmap](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/) is
influenced by the needs and concerns of our community. To help us plan Deis
releases, we invite the community to attend [monthly release planning meetings](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/planning/#release-planning-meetings)
to share with us any issues they'd like to see addressed in the next release.

This week, we held a planning meeting for [Deis v1.10](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/planning/#august-2015-deis-v1-10).
A video of the meeting is on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6tOrv4Uzz4).

Meetings are coordinated on our mailing list. If you're not already a member of the
[deis-users mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/deis-users),
I'd encourage you to sign up. We have a great community of users who share all
sorts of experience running Deis in different environments.

See you at next month's planning meeting!
