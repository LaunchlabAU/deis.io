The Deis project is happy to announce [v1.9.0](https://github.com/deis/deis/releases/tag/v1.9.0), which introduces [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) and [Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org/) tech preview schedulers, provides [custom health checks](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/using_deis/config-application/#custom-health-checks) for your apps, and lays groundwork for the future with [graceful upgrade](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/upgrading-deis/#graceful-upgrade) tools.

<!--more-->

If you are coming from an earlier version of Deis, please read the ["Upgrading Deis"](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/upgrading-deis/) documentation for details.

## What is Deis?

Deis is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds upon [Docker](http://docker.io/) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) to provide a lightweight PaaS with a Heroku-inspired workflow.

## 1.9.0 Summary

### New Features

- [Kubernetes scheduler](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/customizing_deis/choosing-a-scheduler/#k8s-scheduler) tech preview!
- [Mesos with Marathon scheduler](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/customizing_deis/choosing-a-scheduler/#mesos-scheduler) tech preview!
- `deis config:set HEALTHCHECK_URL=/` enables liveness and readiness app [health checks](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/using_deis/config-application/#custom-health-checks)
- Tools for a [graceful upgrade](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/upgrading-deis/#graceful-upgrade) to future versions of Deis are in place
- `deisctl dock` opens a shell or runs commands on a running container
- `deisctl ssh` can also run commands directly on a node
- `deisctl install` can specify the router mesh size (default is 3)
- A faster, more portable `deis` CLI written [in Go](https://github.com/deis/deis/tree/master/client-go) is ready for your testing and feedback!
- `make commit-hook` installs a helper to warn about git [commit style](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/contributing/standards/#commit-style)

### Improvements

- `deisctl` exits with an error if `stop` or `start` fails
- deis-controller enforces correct types for CPU, mem, and tags config
- deis-controller allows non-superusers to manage their keys
- deis-controller ignores setting gunicorn workers < 1
- deis-database backs up the DB on unit stop
- deis-logger uses only one `Ticker` for time-related operations
- deis-publisher displays the HTTP error on connection failure
- deis-router builds the set-misc module for nginx `set_random`
- Makefiles install go tools from golang.org, not code.google.com

### Under the Hood

- Shell scripts throughout the project are validated with [shellcheck](http://www.shellcheck.net/)
- The [`flannel`](https://github.com/coreos/flannel) overlay network is active on newly provisioned clusters
- [`etcd`](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/tag/v2.1.1) v2.1.1 runs in a container on newly provisioned clusters
- Updated vendored [`fleet`](https://github.com/coreos/fleet/) code for `deisctl` to 0.9.2
- Updated vendored [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) code for tests to 1.5.0
- deis-router verifies the downloaded [nginx](http://nginx.org/) archive

For more details, please see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## What's Next

### Builder in Go

The deis-builder component consists of a variety of shell scripts and binary tools which has proved difficult to maintain over time. Rewriting the builder as a set of Go packages will make it easier to test, improve, and extend this core component.

This work is nearly completed. See [PR 4010](https://github.com/deis/deis/pull/4010) for more detail.

### Deis CLI in Go

The `deis` CLI is a one-file python app that has served the project well, but its PyInstaller-based binary packaging is inefficient, and it sometimes runs into incompatibilities with specific platforms. Rewriting the `deis` CLI as a Go binary has already proved to be faster and more portable.

This work is nearly completed. See [PR 4015](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/4015) for more detail.

### TTY Broker

Today Deis cannot provide bi-directional streams needed for log tailing and interactive batch processes. By having the Controller drive a TTY Broker component, Deis can securely open WebSockets through the routing mesh.

See [TTY Broker](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/#tty-broker) at the [Deis Roadmap](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/roadmap/roadmap/) for more detail.

### Teams / Fine-Grained Permissions

Deis uses a simple permissions model currently, involving only two roles: admin and user. Features such as sharing applications, modifying certs, and changing config could be implemented with more specific permissions.

Work is underway on gathering community feedback and implementing teams and more refined permissions. See [issue 4150](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/4150) and [issue 4173](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/4173) for details.

## Community Shout-Outs

The Deis project would like to extend our profound gratitude to 2015 interns Joshua Anderson (@Joshua-Anderson) and Keerthan Mala (@kmala). Joshua attacked the controller, client, and project infrastructure and made myriad improvements while rewriting our world in Go. Keerthan applied his domain expertise and owned Kubernetes (k8s), giving Deis a scheduler for the future. We have all enjoyed working with Joshua and Keerthan more than we can say, and the Deis project is much richer because of them. Thank you!
