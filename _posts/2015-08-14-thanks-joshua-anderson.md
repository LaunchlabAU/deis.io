Everyone involved with Deis extends a heartfelt **thank you** to Joshua Anderson.

Joshua joined the Engine Yard Deis team this summer as an intern, having already
created many features and fixes as an outside contributor. He hit the ground running
so fast, we could barely keep up with him.

Joshua refactored `deisctl`, adding some features and lots of tests. He standardized
and beefed up tests throughout the project. The new, faster `deis` CLI written in
go is due to Joshua's diligence, and somehow he also found time to fix bugs and add
significant features to deis-controller, write documentation, give us a nifty `git`
commit hook, and propose and start implementing an enhanced permissions scheme. He
always asks insightful questions and is fun to work with.

Joshua heads back to school soon, and to say that we will miss him is quite an
understatement. Thanks for everything Joshua, and happy trails until we meet again!
